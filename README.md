# Note-Taker

## Description:
  
This application uses Express to write/save/delete notes to a server, hosted by heroku.
  - I built this application to learn how to use a server to store data, and retrieve it.
  - Building this project I learned how to create routes for different endpoints to help organize my code and files more efficiently.
  
## Installation:
This project can be ran locally using node by running node server.js

Or it can be viewed on Heroku here: https://notetaker-mo2207.herokuapp.com/
